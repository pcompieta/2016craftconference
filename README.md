My personal cut of the great 2016 Craft Conference in Budapest.

# Abstract
- **Marty Cagan - Great Product Team, Successful Product** - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86159035 (closing day1)
- **Dan North - Embracing uncertainty: why you should and why you won't** - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86148915 (opening day1)
  - Agile is about shifting the focus of risk management from reducing uncertainty to managing impact (make it safe to fail)
  - Sustainably minimize Time To "Business Impact"
- Mary Poppendieck - The Future is Here, it's just not evenly distributed - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86186139
  - Products have features. Platforms have communities.  
  - Future: open Banking is coming to EU  
- Tim Steigert - Hacking Monkeys: a practitioners guide - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86189707 (closing conference, intro by Mary Poppendieck)

# Practices & Processes
- **Doc Norton - The Technical Debt Trap** - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86180723
> Do not be reckless: cruft is not debt! 
- **Joseph Pelrine - Psychological Aspects of Estimating** - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86177623 (opening day2)
> An estimation can be given with a number and comfort level (which can trigger a conversation for more info)  
> Be positive, give credit, accept responsibility, tell the truth and respect others to increase your social rank  
- **Sandro Mancuso - Does TDD really lead to good design?** - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86157842 (missed)
> Classist vs Outside-In approaches  
> Architecture, Macro-design, Micro-design.. only this latter benefits from TDD  
> When discussing different designs, try to visualize trade-offs between Straight-forward and Future-proof solutions  
- **Martin Fowler & Erik Dörnenburg - Architecture without architects** - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86152575
> Most of what architects have done traditionally should be done by developers, or by tools, or not at all.  
- Rachel Davies - Extreme Programming Myths & Legends Busted - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86155342 (missed)
- Adam Tornhill - Seven Secrets of Mainatinable Codebases - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86150680
> Metrics on your codebase to understand what needs more care  
> Analyze also architecture to find hidden coupling (e.g. shared lib in microservices)  
- Michael Feathers - Symbiotic Design Practices - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86186717 (missed)

# Tech
## Microservices
- **Dan North - Microservices: Software that Fits in your Head** - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86179657 (missed)
- Adrian Cockcroft - The Evolution of Microservices - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86151804
- **Matt Ranney - What I Wish I Knew Before Scaling Uber to 1,000 Services** - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86156847
- Kelsey Hightower - Building Microservices with gRPC and Kubernetes - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86187859
> When people say "moving to microservices" I hear "declaring [tech debt] bankruptcy"  
> Speaking of (JSON) serialisation debt: every time you use less JavaScript it is gonna be better  
- **Sam Newman - Deploying and Scaling Microservices** - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/87127615
> Microservices: aim for independent deployability. (This removes complex deployment processes)

## Front-end
- Jessica Kerr - Adventures in Elm: Question Your Principles - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86157626
> Functional language compiling to Javascript.. relax, finally.  
> How would you test this? This is functional stuff.. you dont need tests  

## IoT & Big Data
- **Danilo Poccia - Connecting the Unconnected: IoT Made Simple** - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86180860
> IoT by configuration, powered by AWS
- Boaz Avital - Providing Flexible Database Consistency Levels with Manhattan at Twitter - http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86185189
> Tuning DB consistency at runtime
